// User Story

// AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

// Acceptance Criteria

// Click start button and timer starts as a question is presented
// Once a question is answered, show if its correct or wrong then automatically move to the next question.
// If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
// When all the questsion are answered or the time reaches 0, the game is over.
// biggest mistake people make, is how you set up your 

// example:

// varshowBizPizza = []
// var pizza = {
//     toppings: [],
//     size: "big"
// }


// TODO: Set Variable for question # and set variables for questions and arrays as the answers?
var submittedanswer = []
var questions = {
    q1 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"],
    q2 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"],
    q3 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"],
    q4 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"],
    q5 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"],
    q6 = ["answer1",", answer 2",", answer 3",", answer 4"]
}
